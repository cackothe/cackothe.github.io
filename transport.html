Truckload shipping is the movement of large amounts of homogeneous cargo,
generally the amount necessary to fill an entire semi-trailer or intermodal container.
 A truckload carrier is a trucking company that generally contracts an entire trailer-load
 to a single customer. This is as opposed to a less-than truckload (LTL) company that generally
 mixes freight from several customers in each trailer. One advantage Full Truckload (FTL) carriers.
  have over Less than Truckload carriers is that the freight is never handled en route.</P>

<p>A cargo aircraft (also known as freight aircraft, freighter, airlifter or cargo jet) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is designed or converted for the carriage of cargo rather than passengers. Such aircraft usually do not incorporate passenger amenities and generally feature one or more large doors for loading cargo. Freighters may be operated by civil passenger or cargo airlines, by private individuals or by the armed forces of individual countries (for the last see military transport aircraft).</P>
