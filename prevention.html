            <p>Aviation emissions vary based on length of flight.
							 For covering long distances, longer flights are a
							 better investment of the high energy costs of take-off
							 and landing than very short flights, yet by nature of their
							  length inevitably use much more energy. CO2 emissions from air
								 travel range from .24 kg CO2 per
							passenger mile (.15 kg/km per passenger) for short flights down to
							.18 kg CO2 per passenger mile (.11 kg/km per passenger) for long flights
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
							Unleaded gasoline has 8.91 kg and diesel has 10.15 kg of CO2 per gallon.
							 CO2 emissions originating from ethanol are disregarded by international agreements
							  however so gasoline containing 10% ethanol would only be considered to produce 8.02 kg of CO2 per gallon.
								 The average fuel economy for cars sold in the US 2005 was about 25.2 MPG giving around 0.35 kg of CO2 per mile.
								  The Department of Transportation's MOBILE 6.2 model, used by regional governments to model air quality, uses a
									fleet average (all cars, old and new) of 20.3 mpg giving around 0.44 kg of CO2 per mile.
            </p>
						<br />
						<p>
							On average, commuter rail and subway trains emit 0.17 kg of CO2 per
							 passenger mile (0.11 kg/km per passenger), and long distance
							  (>20 mi, >32 km) trains emit 0.19 kg of CO2 per passenger mile (0.12 kg/km per passenger).
								 Some carbon calculations add 10% to the total trip distance to account for detours, stop-overs,
								  and other issues that may arise. Electric trains contributes relatively less to the pollution
									as pollution happens in the power plants which are lot more efficient than diesel driven engines.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							We believe all these facts cause a very high risk to humanity,after all these only some,of the many,causes of cancer and other diseases.
							As we can see the fight with pollution is difficult,with all these impacts of the transport,the quality of life will deteriorate very
							rapidly in the future if we do not take action...
